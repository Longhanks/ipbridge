# ipbridge

REST access to local macOS services. Current features:

- Authentication system via system credentials
  - Login/logout via PAM to securely authenticate access
  - Save login via session cookie
- Access to the Safari Reading List
  - See saved links, preview images and date added
  - Remove elements
  - Add new URLs
  - Instant response using [redis](https://redis.io "redis") cache
- Access to the application's log file
  - Previously logged lines
  - Live stream of new log lines via [socket.io](https://socket.io "socket.io")

## Requirements

- [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io "poetry")
- [redis](https://redis.io "redis")
- [safari-icloud-tabs-fetcher](https://github.com/Longhanks/safari-icloud-tabs-fetcher "safari-icloud-tabs-fetcher") (Included, for iCloud Tabs functionality)
- [ipbridge-web](https://github.com/Longhanks/ipbridge-web "ipbridge-web") (Front End)

## Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

Granting assistive access via System Preferences is required for these processes:
- Development: ```/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python```
- Production: ```/usr/local/bin/gunicorn```

## Running

### Development

```bash
FLASK_APP=ipbridge_app.py FLASK_ENV=development poetry run python3 -m flask run
```

### Production

- LaunchAgent:
  - Change working directory from `/Users/aschulz/Projects/ipbridge` to the deployment directory.
  - Change the stdout and stderr paths to the desired log file path.
- Use the LaunchAgent to start ipbridge.
- Build [ipbridge-web](https://github.com/Longhanks/ipbridge-web "ipbridge-web").
- nginx config:
  - Change the domain name and the path to the SSL certificate + key.
  - `IMAGE_CACHE_PATH` must be a directory where ipbridge can cache temporary images.
  - Change the directory of location `/` to where [ipbridge-web](https://github.com/Longhanks/ipbridge-web "ipbridge-web") was built (`dist`).
- `ipbridge/config.py` (`ProductionConfig`):
  - Change the `IMAGE_CACHE_PATH` if it was changed in the nginx configration.
  - Change `SERVER_NAME` to your the same as in the nginx configuration.
  - Generate a new `SECRET_KEY` via `python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'`.
  - Change `LOG_FILE_PATH` to the stdout path of the LaunchAgent.
  - Do not increase the number of workers, as it breaks flask-socketio ([see also](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#gunicorn-web-server)).

## Ideas/ToDo

- Tests.
